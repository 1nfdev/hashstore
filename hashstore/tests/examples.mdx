consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.
Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.

## LISTS

Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.

### Unordered lists

use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens — interchangably — as list markers:

*   Red
*   Green
*   Blue

is equivalent to:

+   Red
+   Green
+   Blue

and:

-   Red
-   Green
-   Blue

### Ordered lists

use numbers followed by periods:

1.  Bird
2.  McHale
3.  Parish

### To make lists look nice

you can wrap items with hanging indents:

*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
    Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
    viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
    Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

### But if you want to be lazy

you don’t have to:

*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.

## CODE BLOCKS

Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines of a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block in both <pre> and <code> tags.

To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab. For example, given this input:

This is a normal paragraph:

    This is a code block.


## HORIZONTAL RULES

You can produce a horizontal rule tag (<hr />) by placing three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves. If you wish, you may use spaces between the hyphens or asterisks. Each of the following lines will produce a horizontal rule:

* * *

***

*****

## LINKS

Markdown supports two style of links: inline and reference.

In both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].

To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses
immediately after the link text’s closing square bracket. Inside the
parentheses, put the URL where you want the link to point, along with
an optional title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:

This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link.

[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.
Will produce:


See my [About](/about/) page for details.
Reference-style links use a second set of square brackets, inside which you place a label of your choosing to identify the link:

This is [an example][id] reference-style link.
You can optionally use a space to separate the sets of brackets:

This is [an example] [id] reference-style link.
Then, anywhere in the document, you define your link label like this, on a line by itself:

[id]: http://example.com/  "Optional Title Here"

That is:

Square brackets containing the link identifier (optionally indented from the left margin using up to three spaces);
followed by a colon; [foo1][]
followed by one or more spaces (or tabs); [foo2][]
followed by the URL for the link; [foo3][]
optionally followed by a title attribute for the link, enclosed in double or single quotes, or enclosed in parentheses.
The following three link definitions are equivalent:

[foo1]: http://example.com/  "Optional Title Here"
[foo2]: {image_resize(udk:Malbkjdlfj/,300,200)}  'Optional Title Here'
[foo3]: udk://view/Malbkjdlfj.mdx  (Optional Title Here)

udk://img//Malbkjdlfj.mdx

The link URL may, optionally, be surrounded by angle brackets:

[id]: <http://example.com/>  "Optional Title Here"
You can put the title attribute on the next line and use extra spaces or tabs for padding, which tends to look better with longer URLs:

[id]: http://example.com/longish/path/to/resource/here
    "Optional Title Here"
Link definitions are only used for creating links during Markdown processing, and are stripped from your document in the HTML output.

Link definition names may consist of letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation — but they are not case sensitive. E.g. these two links:

[link text][a]
[link text][A]
are equivalent.

The implicit link name shortcut allows you to omit the name of the link, in which case the link text itself is used as the name. Just use an empty set of square brackets — e.g., to link the word “Google” to the google.com web site, you could simply write:

[Google][]
And then define the link:

[Google]: http://google.com/

Because link names may contain spaces, this shortcut even works for multiple words in the link text:

Visit [Daring Fireball][] for more information.
And then define the link:

[Daring Fireball]: http://daringfireball.net/

Link definitions can be placed anywhere in your Markdown document.
I tend to put them immediately after each paragraph in which they’re
used, but if you want, you can put them all at the end of your
document, sort of like footnotes.

Here’s an example of reference links in action:

I get 10 times more traffic from [Google] [1] than from
[Yahoo] [2] or [MSN] [3].

  [1]: http://google.com/        "Google"
  [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
  [3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"

Using the implicit link name shortcut, you could instead write:

I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][] than from
[Yahoo][] or [MSN][].

  [google]: http://google.com/        "Google"
  [yahoo]:  http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
  [msn]:    http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"
Both of the above examples will produce the following HTML output:


With Markdown’s reference-style links, a source document much more
closely resembles the final output, as rendered in a browser. By
allowing you to move the markup-related metadata out of the paragraph, you can add links without interrupting the narrative flow of your prose.

## EMPHASIS

Markdown treats asterisks (*) and underscores (_) as indicators of emphasis. Text wrapped with one * or _ will be wrapped with an HTML <em> tag; double *’s or _’s will be wrapped with an HTML <strong> tag. E.g., this input:

*single asterisks*

_single underscores_

**double asterisks**

__double underscores__
will produce:

<em>single asterisks</em>

<em>single underscores</em>

<strong>double asterisks</strong>

<strong>double underscores</strong>
You can use whichever style you prefer; the lone restriction is that
the same character must be used to open and close an emphasis span.

Emphasis can be used in the middle of a word:

un*frigging*believable
But if you surround an * or _ with spaces, it’ll be treated as a
literal asterisk or underscore.

To produce a literal asterisk or underscore at a position where it
would otherwise be used as an emphasis delimiter, you can backslash
escape it:

\*this text is surrounded by literal asterisks\*
CODE

To indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`). Unlike
a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a normal
paragraph. For example:

Use the `printf()` function.
will produce:

<p>Use the <code>printf()</code> function.</p>
To include a literal backtick character within a code span, you can
use multiple backticks as the opening and closing delimiters:

``There is a literal backtick (`) here.``
which will produce this:

<p><code>There is a literal backtick (`) here.</code></p>
The backtick delimiters surrounding a code span may include spaces
— one after the opening, one before the closing. This allows you to
place literal backtick characters at the beginning or end of a code
span:

A single backtick in a code span: `` ` ``

A backtick-delimited string in a code span: `` `foo` ``
will produce:

<p>A single backtick in a code span: <code>`</code></p>

<p>A backtick-delimited string in a code span: <code>`foo`</code></p>
With a code span, ampersands and angle brackets are encoded as HTML
entities automatically, which makes it easy to include example HTML
tags. Markdown will turn this:

Please don't use any `<blink>` tags.
into:

## IMAGES

Admittedly, it’s fairly difficult to devise a “natural” syntax for
placing images into a plain text document format.

Markdown uses an image syntax that is intended to resemble the syntax
for links, allowing for two styles: inline and reference.

Inline image syntax looks like this:

![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)

![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")
That is:

An exclamation mark: !;
followed by a set of square brackets, containing the alt attribute
text for the image; followed by a set of parentheses, containing the
URL or path to the image, and an optional title attribute enclosed
in double or single quotes.

Reference-style image syntax looks like this:

![Alt text][id]
Where “id” is the name of a defined image reference. Image references are defined using syntax identical to link references:

[id]: url/to/image  "Optional title attribute"
As of this writing, Markdown has no syntax for specifying the dimensions of an image; if this is important to you, you can simply use regular HTML <img> tags.

## MISCELLANEOUS

### AUTOMATIC LINKS

Markdown supports a shortcut style for creating “automatic” links for URLs and email addresses: simply surround the URL or email address with angle brackets. What this means is that if you want to show the actual text of a URL or email address, and also have it be a clickable link, you can do this:

<http://example.com/>
Markdown will turn this into:

<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>
Automatic links for email addresses work similarly, except that Markdown will also perform a bit of randomized decimal and hex entity-encoding to help obscure your address from address-harvesting spambots. For example, Markdown will turn this:

<address@example.com>
into something like this:



### BACKSLASH ESCAPES

Markdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal
characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markdown’s
formatting syntax. For example, if you wanted to surround a word
with literal asterisks (instead of an HTML <em> tag), you can use
backslashes before the asterisks, like this:

\*literal asterisks\*
Markdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters:

\\   backslash
\`   backtick
\*   asterisk
\_   underscore
\{\}  curly braces
\[\]  square brackets
\(\)  parentheses
\#   hash mark
\+   plus sign
\-   minus sign (hyphen)
\.   dot
\!   exclamation mark
